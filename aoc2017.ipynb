    "The night before Christmas, one of Santa's Elves calls you in a panic. \"The printer's broken! We can't print the Naughty or Nice List!\" By the time you make it to sub-basement 17, there are only a few minutes until midnight. \"We have a big problem,\" she says; \"there must be almost fifty bugs in this system, but nothing else can print The List. Stand in this square, quick! There's no time to explain; if you can convince them to pay you in stars, you'll be able to--\" She pulls a lever and the world goes blurry.\n",

    "\n",
    "The captcha requires you to review a sequence of digits (your puzzle input) and find the sum of all digits that match the next digit in the list. The list is circular, so the digit after the last digit is the first digit in the list.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "1122 produces a sum of 3 (1 + 2) because the first digit (1) matches the second digit and the third digit (2) matches the fourth digit.\n",
    "1111 produces 4 because each digit (all 1) matches the next.\n",
    "1234 produces 0 because no digit matches the next.\n",
    "91212129 produces 9 because the only digit that matches the next one is the last digit, 9.\n",

    "\n",

    "The reallocation routine operates in cycles. In each cycle, it finds the memory bank with the most blocks (ties won by the lowest-numbered memory bank) and redistributes those blocks among the banks. To do this, it removes all of the blocks from the selected bank, then moves to the next (by index) memory bank and inserts one of the blocks. It continues doing this until it runs out of blocks; if it reaches the last memory bank, it wraps around to the first one.\n",

    "Starting with the next bank (the fourth bank) and then continuing to the first bank, the second bank, and so on, the 7 blocks are spread out over the memory banks. The fourth, first, and second banks get two blocks each, and the third bank gets one back. The final result looks like this: 2 4 1 2.\n",
    "Next, the second bank is chosen because it contains the most blocks (four). Because there are four memory banks, each gets one block. The result is: 3 1 2 3.\n",
    "Now, there is a tie between the first and fourth memory banks, both of which have three blocks. The first bank wins the tie, and its three blocks are distributed evenly over the other three banks, leaving it with none: 0 2 3 4.\n",
    "The fourth bank is chosen, and its four blocks are distributed such that each of the four banks receives one: 1 3 4 1.\n",
    "The third bank is chosen, and the same thing happens: 2 4 1 2.\n",

If the current position moves past the end of the list, it wraps around to the front. Lengths larger than the size of the list are invalid.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's an example using a smaller list:\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose we instead only had a circular list containing five elements, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and were given input lengths of 3, 4, 1, 5.\n",

    "The first length, 3, selects ([0] 1 2) 3 4 (where parentheses indicate the sublist to be reversed).\n",
    "After reversing that section (0 1 2 into 2 1 0), we get ([2] 1 0) 3 4.\n",
    "Then, the current position moves forward by the length, 3, plus the skip size, 0: 2 1 0 [3] 4. Finally, the skip size increases to 1.\n",
    "The second length, 4, selects a section which wraps: 2 1) 0 ([3] 4.\n",
    "The sublist 3 4 2 1 is reversed to form 1 2 4 3: 4 3) 0 ([1] 2.\n",
    "The current position moves forward by the length plus the skip size, a total of 5, causing it not to move because it wraps around: 4 3 0 [1] 2. The skip size increases to 2.\n",
    "The third length, 1, selects a sublist of a single element, and so reversing it has no effect.\n",
    "The current position moves forward by the length (1) plus the skip size (2): 4 [3] 0 1 2. The skip size increases to 3.\n",
    "The fourth length, 5, selects every element starting with the second: 4) ([3] 0 1 2. Reversing this sublist (3 0 1 2 4 into 4 2 1 0 3) produces: 3) ([4] 2 1 0.\n",
    "Finally, the current position moves forward by 8: 3 4 2 1 [0]. The skip size increases to 4.\n",
    "In this example, the first two numbers in the list end up being 3 and 4; to check the process, you can multiply them together to produce 12.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, you should instead use the standard list size of 256 (with values 0 to 255) and the sequence of lengths in your puzzle input. Once this process is complete, what is the result of multiplying the first two numbers in the list?\n",
    "\n",
    "Your puzzle answer was 38628.\n",
    "\n",
    "--- Part Two ---\n",
    "\n",
    "The logic you've constructed forms a single round of the Knot Hash algorithm; running the full thing requires many of these rounds. Some input and output processing is also required.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, from now on, your input should be taken not as a list of numbers, but as a string of bytes instead. Unless otherwise specified, convert characters to bytes using their ASCII codes. This will allow you to handle arbitrary ASCII strings, and it also ensures that your input lengths are never larger than 255. For example, if you are given 1,2,3, you should convert it to the ASCII codes for each character: 49,44,50,44,51.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you have determined the sequence of lengths to use, add the following lengths to the end of the sequence: 17, 31, 73, 47, 23. For example, if you are given 1,2,3, your final sequence of lengths should be 49,44,50,44,51,17,31,73,47,23 (the ASCII codes from the input string combined with the standard length suffix values).\n",
    "\n",
    "Second, instead of merely running one round like you did above, run a total of 64 rounds, using the same length sequence in each round. The current position and skip size should be preserved between rounds. For example, if the previous example was your first round, you would start your second round with the same length sequence (3, 4, 1, 5, 17, 31, 73, 47, 23, now assuming they came from ASCII codes and include the suffix), but start with the previous round's current position (4) and skip size (4).\n",
    "\n",
    "Once the rounds are complete, you will be left with the numbers from 0 to 255 in some order, called the sparse hash. Your next task is to reduce these to a list of only 16 numbers called the dense hash. To do this, use numeric bitwise XOR to combine each consecutive block of 16 numbers in the sparse hash (there are 16 such blocks in a list of 256 numbers). So, the first element in the dense hash is the first sixteen elements of the sparse hash XOR'd together, the second element in the dense hash is the second sixteen elements of the sparse hash XOR'd together, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if the first sixteen elements of your sparse hash are as shown below, and the XOR operator is ^, you would calculate the first output number like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "65 ^ 27 ^ 9 ^ 1 ^ 4 ^ 3 ^ 40 ^ 50 ^ 91 ^ 7 ^ 6 ^ 0 ^ 2 ^ 5 ^ 68 ^ 22 = 64\n",
    "Perform this operation on each of the sixteen blocks of sixteen numbers in your sparse hash to determine the sixteen numbers in your dense hash.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, the standard way to represent a Knot Hash is as a single hexadecimal string; the final output is the dense hash in hexadecimal notation. Because each number in your dense hash will be between 0 and 255 (inclusive), always represent each number as two hexadecimal digits (including a leading zero as necessary). So, if your first three numbers are 64, 7, 255, they correspond to the hexadecimal numbers 40, 07, ff, and so the first six characters of the hash would be 4007ff. Because every Knot Hash is sixteen such numbers, the hexadecimal representation is always 32 hexadecimal digits (0-f) long.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are some example hashes:\n",
    "\n",
    "The empty string becomes a2582a3a0e66e6e86e3812dcb672a272.\n",
    "AoC 2017 becomes 33efeb34ea91902bb2f59c9920caa6cd.\n",

    "You need to cross a vast firewall. The firewall consists of several layers, each with a security scanner that moves back and forth across the layer. To succeed, you must not be detected by a scanner.\n",

    "By studying the firewall briefly, you are able to record (in your puzzle input) the depth of each layer and the range of the scanning area for the scanner within it, written as depth: range. Each layer has a thickness of exactly 1. A layer at depth 0 begins immediately inside the firewall; a layer at depth 1 would start immediately after that.\n",

    "Your plan is to hitch a ride on a packet about to move through the firewall. The packet will travel along the top of each layer, and it moves at one layer per picosecond. Each picosecond, the packet moves one layer forward (its first move takes it into layer 0), and then the scanners move one step. If there is a scanner at the top of the layer as your packet enters it, you are caught. (If a scanner moves into the top of its layer while you are there, you are not caught: it doesn't have time to notice you before you leave.)

    "Suddenly, a scheduled job activates the system's disk defragmenter. Were the situation different, you might sit and watch it for a while, but today, you just don't have that kind of time. It's soaking up valuable system resources that are needed elsewhere, and so the only option is to help it finish its task as soon as possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "The disk in question consists of a 128x128 grid; each square of the grid is either free or used. On this disk, the state of the grid is tracked by the bits in a sequence of knot hashes.\n",
    "\n",
    "A total of 128 knot hashes are calculated, each corresponding to a single row in the grid; each hash contains 128 bits which correspond to individual grid squares. Each bit of a hash indicates whether that square is free (0) or used (1).\n",
    "\n",
    "The hash inputs are a key string (your puzzle input), a dash, and a number from 0 to 127 corresponding to the row. For example, if your key string were flqrgnkx, then the first row would be given by the bits of the knot hash of flqrgnkx-0, the second row from the bits of the knot hash of flqrgnkx-1, and so on until the last row, flqrgnkx-127.\n",
    "\n",
    "The output of a knot hash is traditionally represented by 32 hexadecimal digits; each of these digits correspond to 4 bits, for a total of 4 * 32 = 128 bits. To convert to bits, turn each hexadecimal digit to its equivalent binary value, high-bit first: 0 becomes 0000, 1 becomes 0001, e becomes 1110, f becomes 1111, and so on; a hash that begins with a0c2017... in hexadecimal would begin with 10100000110000100000000101110000... in binary.\n",

Every used square is in exactly one region: lone used squares form their own isolated regions, while several adjacent squares all count as a single region.\n",

    "## Day 17: Spinlock\n",
    "\n",
    "Suddenly, whirling in the distance, you notice what looks like a massive, pixelated hurricane: a deadly spinlock. This spinlock isn't just consuming computing power, but memory, too; vast, digital mountains are being ripped from the ground and consumed by the vortex.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you don't move quickly, fixing that printer will be the least of your problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "This spinlock's algorithm is simple but efficient, quickly consuming everything in its path. It starts with a circular buffer containing only the value 0, which it marks as the current position. It then steps forward through the circular buffer some number of steps (your puzzle input) before inserting the first new value, 1, after the value it stopped on. The inserted value becomes the current position. Then, it steps forward from there the same number of steps, and wherever it stops, inserts after it the second new value, 2, and uses that as the new current position again.\n",
    "\n",
    "It repeats this process of stepping forward, inserting a new value, and using the location of the inserted value as the new current position a total of 2017 times, inserting 2017 as its final operation, and ending with a total of 2018 values (including 0) in the circular buffer.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if the spinlock were to step 3 times per insert, the circular buffer would begin to evolve like this (using parentheses to mark the current position after each iteration of the algorithm):\n",
    "\n",
    "(0), the initial state before any insertions.\n",
    "0 (1): the spinlock steps forward three times (0, 0, 0), and then inserts the first value, 1, after it. 1 becomes the current position.\n",
    "0 (2) 1: the spinlock steps forward three times (0, 1, 0), and then inserts the second value, 2, after it. 2 becomes the current position.\n",
    "0  2 (3) 1: the spinlock steps forward three times (1, 0, 2), and then inserts the third value, 3, after it. 3 becomes the current position.\n",
    "And so on:\n",
    "\n",
    "0  2 (4) 3  1\n",
    "0 (5) 2  4  3  1\n",

    "0 (9) 5  7  2  4  3  8  6  1\n",
    "Eventually, after 2017 insertions, the section of the circular buffer near the last insertion looks like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "1512  1134  151 (2017) 638  1513  851\n",
    "Perhaps, if you can identify the value that will ultimately be after the last value written (2017), you can short-circuit the spinlock. In this example, that would be 638.\n",

    "The spinlock does not short-circuit. Instead, it gets more angry. At least, you assume that's what happened; it's spinning significantly faster than it was a moment ago.\n",
    "\n",
    "You have good news and bad news.\n",
    "\n",
    "The good news is that you have improved calculations for how to stop the spinlock. They indicate that you actually need to identify the value after 0 in the current state of the circular buffer.\n",
    "\n",
    "The bad news is that while you were determining this, the spinlock has just finished inserting its fifty millionth value (50000000).\n",

    "\n",
    "You discover a tablet containing some strange assembly code labeled simply \"Duet\". Rather than bother the sound card with it, you decide to run the code yourself. Unfortunately, you don't see any documentation, so you're left to figure out what the instructions mean on your own.\n",
    "\n",
    "It seems like the assembly is meant to operate on a set of registers that are each named with a single letter and that can each hold a single integer. You suppose each register should start with a value of 0.\n",
    "\n",
    "There aren't that many instructions, so it shouldn't be hard to figure out what they do. Here's what you determine:\n",
    "```\n",
    "snd X plays a sound with a frequency equal to the value of X.\n",
    "set X Y sets register X to the value of Y.\n",
    "add X Y increases register X by the value of Y.\n",
    "mul X Y sets register X to the result of multiplying the value contained in register X by the value of Y.\n",
    "mod X Y sets register X to the remainder of dividing the value contained in register X by the value of Y (that is, it sets X to the result of X modulo Y).\n",
    "rcv X recovers the frequency of the last sound played, but only when the value of X is not zero. (If it is zero, the command does nothing.)\n",
    "jgz X Y jumps with an offset of the value of Y, but only if the value of X is greater than zero. (An offset of 2 skips the next instruction, an offset of -1 jumps to the previous instruction, and so on.)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Many of the instructions can take either a register (a single letter) or a number. The value of a register is the integer it contains; the value of a number is that number.\n",
    "\n",
    "After each jump instruction, the program continues with the instruction to which the jump jumped. After any other instruction, the program continues with the next instruction. Continuing (or jumping) off either end of the program terminates it.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example:\n",
    "```\n",
    "set a 1\n",

    "mul a a\n",
    "mod a 5\n",

    "```\n",
    "The first four instructions set a to 1, add 2 to it, square it, and then set it to itself modulo 5, resulting in a value of 4.\n",
    "Then, a sound with frequency 4 (the value of a) is played.\n",
    "After that, a is set to 0, causing the subsequent rcv and jgz instructions to both be skipped (rcv because a is 0, and jgz because a is not greater than 0).\n",
    "Finally, a is set to 1, causing the next jgz instruction to activate, jumping back two instructions to another jump, which jumps again to the rcv, which ultimately triggers the recover operation.\n",
    "At the time the recover operation is executed, the frequency of the last sound played is 4.\n",
    "\n",
    "What is the value of the recovered frequency (the value of the most recently played sound) the first time a rcv instruction is executed with a non-zero value?\n",

    "\n",
    "--- Part Two ---\n",
    "As you congratulate yourself for a job well done, you notice that the documentation has been on the back of the tablet this entire time. While you actually got most of the instructions correct, there are a few key differences. This assembly code isn't about sound at all - it's meant to be run twice at the same time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each running copy of the program has its own set of registers and follows the code independently - in fact, the programs don't even necessarily run at the same speed. To coordinate, they use the send (snd) and receive (rcv) instructions:\n",
    "\n",
    "snd X sends the value of X to the other program. These values wait in a queue until that program is ready to receive them. Each program has its own message queue, so a program can never receive a message it sent.\n",
    "rcv X receives the next value and stores it in register X. If no values are in the queue, the program waits for a value to be sent to it. Programs do not continue to the next instruction until they have received a value. Values are received in the order they are sent.\n",
    "Each program also has its own program ID (one 0 and the other 1); the register p should begin with this value.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example:\n",
    "```\n",
    "snd 1\n",
    "snd 2\n",
    "snd p\n",
    "rcv a\n",
    "rcv b\n",
    "rcv c\n",
    "rcv d\n",
    "```\n",
    "Both programs begin by sending three values to the other. Program 0 sends 1, 2, 0; program 1 sends 1, 2, 1. Then, each program receives a value (both 1) and stores it in a, receives another value (both 2) and stores it in b, and then each receives the program ID of the other program (program 0 receives 1; program 1 receives 0) and stores it in c. Each program now sees a different value in its own copy of register c.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, both programs try to rcv a fourth time, but no data is waiting for either of them, and they reach a deadlock. When this happens, both programs terminate.\n",
    "\n",
    "It should be noted that it would be equally valid for the programs to run at different speeds; for example, program 0 might have sent all three values and then stopped at the first rcv before program 1 executed even its first instruction.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once both of your programs have terminated (regardless of what caused them to do so), how many times did program 1 send a value?\n",
